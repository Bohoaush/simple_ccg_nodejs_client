# simple_ccg_nodejs_client

## Description
This node.js app is a simple multiplatform CasparCG client.

## Warning
This app is still in development and it is also my first node.js app, therefore I don't recommend using it in production enviroments.

## Prerequisities
- node.js runtime
- web browser (preferably chromium based)
- git

Then you can just clone this repository.

## How to use
- run CasparCG media scanner
- run CasparCG
- run this app with "node main.js"
- go to the webinterface, by default running at 127.0.0.1:8084
- to change settings, edit the settings.json file, that is generated after the first run
